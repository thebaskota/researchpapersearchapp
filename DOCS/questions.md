Questions You Should Ask ipf electronic Before Starting the Task
1. Understand Their Target Groups Better
You need to know exactly who they want to convince.
Ask:
Can you describe typical roles in each group (design, technology, QA, process data management, maintenance)?
What problems do these roles usually face that your sensors help solve?
Which industries matter most right now (automotive, plastics, metal… or others)?
Who is the most important decision-maker when choosing sensor solutions?

2. Clarify Your Goal
The task says “find new ways to draw attention” but that is broad. Ask:
What type of solution are you expecting?
(e.g., marketing campaign, digital strategy, product demo ideas, events, outreach methods, partnerships)
Are you expecting something that can be implemented in the next 6 months, or a long-term vision?
What does “success” look like to you?
(More calls, more meetings, more website traffic, more demo requests, etc.)

3. Understand Their Products & USP (Unique Selling Points)
To communicate added value, you must understand what value they want to highlight.
Ask:
Which specific optimization solutions should we focus on?
(Sensors? Logic modules? Custom solutions?)
What pain points do your solutions uniquely solve compared to competitors?
Do you have real use cases or examples where your solution greatly improved a customer’s system?
What do customers say after using your custom solutions?
(Any testimonials, outcomes, improvements?)

4. Understand Their Current Marketing & Sales Funnel
Ask:
Besides calls and spontaneous visits, what other tactics are currently used?
(Website, LinkedIn, trade fairs, newsletters, webinars?)
What has worked well in the past, even if only a little?
What has not worked at all?
Do you have analytics (website traffic, conversion rates, typical customer journey)?

5. Learn Their Limitations & Constraints
So you don’t propose ideas that are impossible for them.
Ask:
What is your marketing budget (even a rough range)?
Do you have an in-house marketing team, or only sales + technical team?
Are there channels you do NOT want to use?
(e.g., paid advertising, social media, etc.)
How much can your team handle in terms of content creation?
(Videos? Tutorials? Case studies?)

6. Understand Why Current Contact Methods Are Not Enough
Ask:
What problems do you face with cold calls?
(Low pickup rate? Wrong target roles? Not enough time to explain value?)
When you visit companies in person, what challenges or objections arise?
How do customers usually first hear about you today?

7. Competitive Positioning
You need to clearly distinguish IPF from Sick, ifm, Keyence, etc.
Ask:
What do customers say when they switch from competitors to IPF?
Why do some customers choose competitors instead of IPF?
Are there specific niches where IPF is clearly better?

8. Resources for the Makerthon
Ask:
Can you share the “Unique Sensor Solutions” flyer they mentioned?
Do you have a short product overview or sales deck we can use?
Do you have pictures or videos of:
sensors in use
installations
before/after improvements

9. Logistics for the Makerthon
Ask:
Do you want us to contact Christian/Dirk during brainstorming if we need clarification?
Should we focus on B2B outreach only, or also branding?
Will we get access to any internal materials, or should we work only with public info?
