Here is a **tight, clear, fast-to-present pitch deck** you can read directly to your team.
10 slides. High-impact. Makerthon-ready.

# **⭐ PITCH DECK — “ipf Growth Engine: Making ipf Unignorable”**

### *(Short, powerful, group-ready)*

---

## **SLIDE 1 — Title**

**ipf Growth Engine:**
*How to Win Attention, Trust, and Market Share in a Saturated Industrial Sensor Market*

---

## **SLIDE 2 — The Core Problem**

* Engineers don’t care about brands.
* They care about **downtime, scrap, and failures**.
* Young engineers don’t pick up phones → traditional outreach is failing.
* Competitors win on *price* and *scale*.
* ipf wins when we’re *in the room*, but we don't get enough invitations.

---

## **SLIDE 3 — The Opportunity**

ipf’s superpower =
**High-reliability, custom-fit solutions that prevent expensive failures.**

We reposition ipf from a “sensor vendor” to:
**“The partner that keeps your machines running.”**

---

## **SLIDE 4 — The Grand Slam Offer (Hormozi)**

Stop selling products.
Start selling **outcomes**.

**⚡ Free Automation Reliability Audit (Worth €2,000):**

* 60-minute on-site check
* Failure-point mapping
* Quick wins
* ROI overview
* Custom recommendations

This becomes the *primary door-opener* instead of cold calling.

---

## **SLIDE 5 — Wedge Offers (Entry Points)**

Targeted demo kits for specific pains:

1. **High-Temperature Sensor Survival Kit**
2. **Zero-Failure Position Detection Pack**
3. **Process Data Visibility Starter Pack**
4. **Logic Module Simulation Kit**

These are mini-offers that get us into niche problems where we win.

---

## **SLIDE 6 — Proof Engine**

Engineers trust **data**, not marketing.

Build a “Proof Vault” with:

* Before/after downtime
* Harsh environment tests
* Case studies vs competitors
* Videos from field engineers
* Real installations

This increases conversion massively.

---

## **SLIDE 7 — Authority Through Education**

To reach young decision-makers:

* Short technical videos (30–60 sec)
* Failure mode breakdowns
* “What went wrong at this factory?”
* Blog + LinkedIn posts
* Application notes
* Sensor selection tools (Configurator, ROI calculator, etc.)

Teach the market → own the market.

---

## **SLIDE 8 — University Pipeline (ipf for the next generation)**

Build future awareness through students.

1. **ipf University League** — annual automation challenge
2. **Sponsored ipf Sensor Kits** for engineering clubs
3. **Innovation Grants** for student projects
4. **University Ambassadors**
5. **ipf Certification (Level 1)** for students
6. **Hackathons** with prizes and internships

Young engineers enter industry *already knowing ipf*.

---

## **SLIDE 9 — The Full System**

A self-reinforcing loop:

1. Students → Awareness early
2. Content → Authority
3. Website + tools → Trust
4. Wedge kits → Entry
5. Free audit → Engagement
6. Field engineers → Conversion
7. Case proof → Sales justification
8. Stories → More reach

Brand grows organically and sustainably.

---

## **SLIDE 10 — The Vision**

ipf becomes the **most trusted reliability partner** in automation —
not because we are the cheapest,
but because we solve the most expensive problems.

**“When failure is not an option — you call ipf.”**
