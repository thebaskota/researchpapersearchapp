How can we find new ways to draw the attention of decision-makers and specialists from design, technology, quality assurance, process data management and maintenance to ipf and convincingly convey the added value of our optimization solutions to them?

Contact person in the company Contact for strategic questions:
Christian Fiebach, 0171 2128089 / Dirk Neuhaus, 0170 3252537
Contact for technical questions:
Christian Fiebach, 0171 2128089 / Dirk Neuhaus, 0170 3252537


Further information/Appendix:
This is how we currently proceed with the first contact:
*   We call potential customers to make an appointment for a product presentation or presentation by our technical field service.
*   In addition, we occasionally visit companies spontaneously, i.e. without prior registration, to present ourselves and our products directly on site
Competitive:
We operate in a market where there is strong competition.
The largest providers in this area - such as Sick, ifm, Pepperl+Fuchs, Turk, Balluff, Wenglor, Panasonic, Omron or Keyence - are large, internationally active companies based mainly in Germany or Japan. These manufacturers sell their products worldwide and have production sites in many countries. By mass-producing large quantities, they can produce their standard products very cost-effectively and thus offer low unit prices.
Who do we try to contact and why?
Due to today's market situation and the large production possibilities of other suppliers, we cannot always offer the lowest price for standard products.
However, our strength does not lie in price, but in our understanding of applications and their requirements.
In practice, there are usually several possible solutions for a technical task - such as optimising systems, quality control, automation or data acquisition. Which of these works most reliably depends heavily on the operating conditions and the environment. Finding the best solution requires experience and technical know-how. This is exactly where our competence lies:
Our technical field service has extensive knowledge and many years of experience to recommend the right solution for (almost) every application.
That's why we attach particular importance to talking to technical contacts in companies - because this is the only way we can specifically show what concrete advantages our products offer in use.
For an optimal recommendation, it is also important that our employees get to know the actual operating conditions on site.
If it turns out that no product from our existing range fully meets the requirements, we can also develop an application-specific solution - of course, only if it is economically feasible.
