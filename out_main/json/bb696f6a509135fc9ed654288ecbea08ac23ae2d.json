    "year": 2004,
    "abstract": "A self-contained presentation of scattering theory for periodic structures is given. The main result is the Modified Rayleigh Conjecture (MRC), which provides a rigorous foundation for a numerical method to solve direct scattering problems for periodic structures. Existence and uniqueness of the solution are established via the limiting absorption principle and resolvent analysis. A practical numerical implementation based on singular value decomposition is described, and numerical experiments demonstrate the stability and accuracy of the method.",
