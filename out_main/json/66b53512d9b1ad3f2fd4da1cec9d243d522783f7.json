    "title": "A holistic finite difference approach models linear dynamics consistently",
    "authors": [
      "A. J. Roberts"
    ],
    "year": 2018,
    "abstract": "I prove that a centre manifold approach to creating finite difference models will consistently model linear dynamics as the grid spacing becomes small. Using tools from dynamical systems theory provides assurances about the quality of finite difference models under nonlinear and other perturbations on grids with finite spacing. For example, the advection-diffusion equation is shown to be stably modelled for all advection speeds and grid spacings. The theorems establish appropriate artificial internal boundary conditions required to apply centre manifold theory, and demonstrate that systematically derived finite difference models have excellent stability and consistency properties.",
