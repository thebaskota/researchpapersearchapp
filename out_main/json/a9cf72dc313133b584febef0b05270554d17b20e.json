    "authors": [
      "Alexander G. Ramm"
    ],
    "year": 2006,
    "abstract": "Necessary and sufficient conditions for the compactness of embedding operators between Banach spaces are established. An improvement of the author's earlier result is presented, removing the assumption that an intermediate space must be Hilbert. The paper also constructs a counterexample to a published statement concerning compactness of embeddings when compatibility of norms is not assumed.",
