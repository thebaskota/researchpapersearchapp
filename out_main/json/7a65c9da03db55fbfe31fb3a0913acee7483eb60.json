    "title": "HIGHER ORDER RECURRENCES FOR ANALYTICAL FUNCTIONS OF TCHEBYSHEFF TYPE",
    "authors": [
      "A. K. Kwasniewski"
    ],
    "year": 2004,
    "abstract": "This note extends earlier work to define and study a generalization of Tchebysheff (Chebyshev) polynomial systems using one-parameter subgroups related to hyperbolons of volume one and higher-order hyperbolic functions. It develops higher-order recurrence relations (moving from a Z2 to a Zn decomposition viewpoint), relates these generalized Tchebysheff systems to functions of roots of polynomials of arbitrary degree as a generalization of Lucas-type symmetric functions, and gives an explicit connection between the two. An application to a broad class of iterative dynamical systems governed by matrix recurrences and Cayley\u2013Hamilton relations is discussed.",
