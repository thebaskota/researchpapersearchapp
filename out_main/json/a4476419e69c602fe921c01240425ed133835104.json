    "title": "Holistic projection of initial conditions onto a finite difference approximation",
    "authors": [
      "A. J. Roberts"
    ],
    "year": 2001,
    "abstract": "The geometric viewpoint of centre manifold theory is used to derive correct initial conditions for finite difference discretisations of partial differential equations. Building on holistic finite difference models for equations such as Burgers’ equation, the paper shows how to project initial fields onto the finite-dimensional numerical model in a way that is dynamically consistent and conservative. The resulting projection accounts for subgrid-scale processes and improves the accuracy of forecasts made with finite difference approximations.",
