    "title": "ON DUALITY TRIADS",
    "authors": [
      "A. K. Kwasniewski"
    ],
    "year": 2003,
    "abstract": "The paper introduces the notion of duality triads, defined as systems of dual recurrence relations completed by a third relation linking polynomial sequences and connection constants. These triads are interpreted as discrete-time dynamical systems generated by transition matrices. Several representative examples are developed, including Pascal, Stirling, Hermite, Laguerre, and Tchebychev triads, together with their associated polynomial systems and combinatorial triangles. Connections with finite operator calculus, umbral calculus, and orthogonal polynomial systems are analyzed.",
