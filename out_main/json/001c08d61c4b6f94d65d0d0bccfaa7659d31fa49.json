    "abstract": "The paper examines ancient earthworks near Lake Titicaca as a large-scale example of graphic design created in a pre-literate society. Using Google satellite imagery and image processing techniques, the study identifies geoglyphs embedded in agricultural raised fields and terraced hills. The work highlights how satellite image enhancement supports archaeological interpretation and reveals symbolic landforms representing animals and geometric figures.",
