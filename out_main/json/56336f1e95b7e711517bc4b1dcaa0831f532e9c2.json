    "title": "Fractional differentiation based image processing",
    "authors": [
      "Amelia Carolina Sparavigna"
    ],
    "year": 2009,
    "abstract": "The paper discusses the application of fractional differential calculus to digital image processing. It introduces discrete fractional derivatives and fractional gradients for two-dimensional image maps and shows how non-integer order differentiation enhances edge detection and image quality. Applications include filtering, restoration, and the detection of faint objects in astronomical images, demonstrating improved contrast and visibility compared to classical integer-order methods.",
