    "abstract": "The paper develops trigonometric-like decompositions of analytic functions with respect to the cyclic group of order n using cyclic group labeled projection operators. Higher-order hyperbolic and circular functions are constructed as eigenfunctions of scaling operators, and de Moivre-type identities are generalized via circulant matrices. Determinant identities for circulant and alpha-circulant matrices are derived, and extensions to q-deformations and psi-extensions of special polynomial systems are presented, including q-hyperbolic and psi-hyperbolic functions.",
