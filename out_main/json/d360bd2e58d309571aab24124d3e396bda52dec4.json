    "abstract": "One shows that the Last Fermat Theorem is equivalent to the statement that all rational solutions x^k + y^k = 1 (k ≥ 2) are provided by an orbit of a rationally parametrized subgroup of a group preserving a k-ubic form. This group arises naturally in the framework of generalized Clifford algebras. The paper analyzes the structure of these groups, their action on solution sets, and formulates corresponding higher-dimensional hypotheses.",
