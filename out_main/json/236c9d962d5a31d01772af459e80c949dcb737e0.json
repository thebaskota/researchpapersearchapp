    "title": "ON RESIDUALLY S2 IDEALS AND PROJECTIVE DIMENSION ONE MODULES",
    "authors": [
      "Alberto Corso",
      "Claudia Polini"
    ],
    "year": 2002,
    "abstract": "The paper establishes cancellation properties for ideals and modules in local Gorenstein rings. It proves faithfulness results for certain modules and derives consequences for reduction numbers, integral closures, and residual intersections of ideals satisfying Gs conditions. The work analyzes residually S2 ideals, reduction theory, Rees algebras, and projective dimension one modules using techniques from linkage theory and blowup algebras.",
