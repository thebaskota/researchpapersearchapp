    "abstract": "The paper studies the core of an ideal, defined as the intersection of all its reductions. In a broad Cohen–Macaulay setting, it proves that the core is a finite intersection of general minimal reductions, identifies it as the contraction of a universal ℓ-generated ideal, and establishes its compatibility with flat extensions. The results rely on multiplicity estimates and techniques from residual intersection theory, and apply to large classes of ideals satisfying Gℓ and residual S2 conditions.",
