    "title": "ON FIBONOMIAL AND OTHER TRIANGLES VERSUS DUALITY TRIADS",
    "authors": [
      "A. K. Kwasniewski"
    ],
    "year": 2003,
    "abstract": "The paper studies Fibonomial triangles, q-Gaussian triangles, Catalan triangles and related Pascal-like structures within the framework of duality triads. These combinatorial arrays are interpreted as discrete-time dynamical systems governed by recurrence relations. The work analyzes when dual recurrences and triad polynomial sequences exist, characterizes persistent root polynomial sequences and orthogonal polynomial systems that generate duality triads, and examines the role of finite operator calculus and incidence algebras in this setting.",
